/**
 * This class allows us to represent ApplicationExceptions in a serializable form.
 *   
 * When an exception is raised, the {@link ApplicationException} class (or its child)
 * can be used to structurize the exception. Afterwards, the ApplicationException can be 
 * transformed it into an ErrorDescription using the {@link ErrorDescriptionFactory}, serialized 
 * in one language, transferred to the receiving side, and deserialized in another language.
 * 
 * After deserialization, one of the following is done: 
 * 
 * - if the exception was initally a child of ApplicationException, the exception's class can be 
 * restored using the {@link ApplicationExceptionFactory}.
 * 
 * - if a specific exception was raised and transferred between microservices that are written 
 * in different languages, then the exception type that is closest to the original exception's 
 * type can be chosen from the exceptions available in the target language. 
 * This provides cross-language error propagation via serialization.
