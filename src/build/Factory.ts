 * - a constructor (in which the object types are registered using the {@link #registerAsType} method).
 * 
 * #### Example Descriptor:
 *     public static readonly MyClassDescriptor: Descriptor = new Descriptor("my-services", "factory", "my-class", "default", "1.0");

 * #### Example constructor: 
 *     public constructor() {
